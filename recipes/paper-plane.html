    <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>The ideal <em>aperitivo</em>: simple to make, easy to drink.</p>
        <p>The drink, invented by the New York bartender Sam Ross, who created the classic modern cocktail the penicillin, has slowly been gaining steam since it was introduced in 2007, showing up on cocktail menus in numerous time zones. It is a rich, immediately likable whiskey sour lent plenty of culinary complexity by the amaro and the Aperol. <strong>—Robert Simonson</strong></p>
