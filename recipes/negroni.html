    <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>The Negroni is a classic Italian cocktail made with gin, sweet vermouth, and the bitter liqueur Campari. Although it's a simple, three ingredient cocktail, it's actually a pretty easy drink to mess up.</p>
        <p>The vermouth you choose to use for your Negroni cocktail is personal—try a few and see what you like. We recommend Carpano Antico (an Italian red vermouth), Martini & Rossi (slightly sweeter), or Dolin Rouge (drier).</p>
        <p>Campari and red vermouth both add strong bitter fruit and botanical flavors to the Negroni. Like vermouth, different types of gin can also have varying herbal notes. A straightforward gin may be your best bet, so as to not compete with the other components of the drink. Beefeater London Dry and Tanqueray No. 10. are both smooth, dry gins with notes of juniper and citrus, which go nicely with both the red vermouth and Campari.</p>
