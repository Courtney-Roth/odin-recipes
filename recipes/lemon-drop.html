    <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>The Lemon Drop first squeezed to life in San Francisco sometime during the 1970s. Its inventor, Norman Jay Hobday, an out-of-work Vietnam vet turned saloon owner, is also credited with opening the country's first fern bar, a concept that mixed house plants and Tiffany lamps with throngs of upwardly mobile urbanites.</p>
        <p>Both were an instant hit. And for two-plus decades, the Lemon Drop dominated cocktail menus from North Beach to Bangkok, hooking a generation of bar patrons on its boozy-tart-sweet mélange of vodka, citrus and sugar. In 2006, Oprah famously served one to Rachael Ray on her show, which is like the ultimate nod of widespread acceptance and further solidified the drink's place in popular culture.</p>
        <p>Some mislabel the Lemon Drop as a Martini. But its closest cocktail kin is actually the Crusta, a New Orleans invention that dates to the 1850s and, like the Lemon Drop, is distinguished by its sugared rim. It may be tempting to save time by skipping this important step, but take the extra minute to coat the rim with sugar. It's worth the effort, and that first saccharine brush against the lips before the onrush of vodka, lemon and orange fills your mouth is the drink's calling card.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ounces frozen vodka</li>
            <li>½ ounce triple sec</li>
            <li>1 ounce lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 ounce simple syrup</li>
            <li>Garnish: sugar rim</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Coat the rim of a cocktail glass with sugar and set aside (do this a few minutes ahead so the sugar can dry and adhere well to the glass).</li>
            <li>Add the vodka, triple sec, lemon juice and simple syrup to a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.</li>
            <li>Strain into the prepared glass.</li>
        </ol>
